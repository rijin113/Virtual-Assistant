# Virtual-Assistant (New and Improved) 


ClinicRehabServicesChatbot.html: This file represents the clinic virtual assistant I built for Azsure Health and Rehab. It allows the user to book an appointment and learn about the various services and products the clinic offers for its clients.

WeatherServicesChatbot.html: This file represents the weather virtual assistant built for daily use. You can find out the temperature of any place in the world along with the humidity, wind speed, and precipitation probability. 

Built in: AWS (Amazon Lex), Node.js, HTML, CSS, Tensorflow, and open weather API. The virtual assistants can recognize grammatical and structral errors from the users and still respond back appropriately.

The following HTML files only consist of code that allows me to connect AWS services and intents to a regular web page. These files also include code to integrate voice recognition. However, most of the Node.js script that was coded to connect API's and messages is only available in the Lambda Console. But the code is still provided in the .js files.
