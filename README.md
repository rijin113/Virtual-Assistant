Using Node.js (BackEnd Javascript) , HTML, CSS, Amazon Lex, Machine Learning (Tensorflow), and Api's, two chatbots were created. One for the weather and the other for a clinic. The first assistant tells you about the weather and other things related to it, and the other books an appointment and gives you information on the services of that clinic. A very hard project to build. It tooks approxmiately 2-3 months for me to compute the alogrithms and code for this program.
